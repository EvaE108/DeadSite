    <p> Well well well it seems you have stumbled upon tiny corner of the internet <br>
        This sight was created for those who love the thrill of the unknown. For those seeking something <br>
        hidden between the lines of this dull world. <br>
        But do not be fooled by my cordial manner, this website was not simply meant to be a brainteaser, it was meant to be truely scary <br>
        But whaat makes something truely scary? <br>
        Well a true student of fright knows that the scariest things are the ones that blur the line betweeen reality and fiction. <br>
        They are the things that if even only for a moment you ask yourself is thi real? <br>
        Once you begin this jouney of fear and fun just know there will be NO help along the way <br>
